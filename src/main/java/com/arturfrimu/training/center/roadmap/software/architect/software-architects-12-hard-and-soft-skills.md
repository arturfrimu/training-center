# Software architects: 12 hard and soft skills needed to become a leader

If you went to a job site right now and searched for a software architect, you’d find more than 18,500
job openings. These professionals are difficult to find and highly in demand.
They’ll likely ask for a degree in computer science, engineering, or equivalent
experience and list job responsibilities, such as:

### Provide experienced leadership and technical direction

Accountable for platform features, from prioritization to design to release

### Own the full software development lifecycle - problem definition, design, development

That’s a pretty broad description.
Many also include language such as this: 50% technical leadership and 50% hands-on development.
Depending on the project, they may list specific programming languages they require you to be proficient in.
If you’re looking to fill one of these jobs, it can be a tough search.
However, developing the right skills to become a software architect means there are many high-paying jobs available.

# What is a software architect?

A software architect makes high-level design choices and frames technical standards.
This might include tools, software coding standards, or platforms to be used.
To be effective, a software architect needs broad (and deep) technical knowledge to make good decisions.
However, technical knowledge isn’t enough.
They also have to have the soft skills to manage projects and people.
Let’s review the soft skills and the hard skills needed.

# Software architect:  hard skills needed

There’s no one-size-fits-all definition because different projects may require different technical knowledge, but there
are some skills that all projects will require.

- Unified Modeling Language (UML) is often listed as an essential requirement.
  What is certainty essential is familiarity with diagramming complex architectures.
- Searching for candidates with a deep knowledge of one or more programming languages essential to the business to
  support their long-term goals strategically.
  This could be anything: Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, Go, C, or even COBOL.
- Manage software development practices in a collaborative and agile fashion.  
  That often means a deep familiarity with DevOps practices.
  This takes hard skills, such as creating an efficient DevOps environment, and soft skills, to keep development and
  operations teams aligned.

# Software architect:  soft skills needed

However, just as important as the technology-related skills are the "soft" skills that can drive performance and bring
team members together for successful projects.

### Leadership

Leadership - Overseeing the development of a project and coordinating teams of developers to meet design standards
requires significant leadership.
Software architects must be able to juggle the needs and demands of projects and teams.

### Problem-solving & conflict resolution -

Managing and coordinating all of the elements that go into a successful application project requires strong
problem-solving skills – both technical and human.

### Communication

Communication is a key ingredient in any leadership position.
To get the best of teams, software architects must clearly explain the mission, deadlines, and expectations.

### Coaching & inspiration

If expectations aren’t being met, leaders have to coach and inspire team members to achieve.

### Organization

Since software architects set the roadmap for development, being organized is key.
Often large-scale and intricate UML diagrams are necessary, which requires a systematic and organized way of thinking.

### Prioritizing

Software architects need to quickly prioritize tasks and juggle team members' assignments throughout a product’s
development.

### Detailed thinking

In any development project, there are a significant number of details that must be managed correctly.
This requires extreme attention to detail to make sure the project code meets objectives.

### Creative thinking

The software architect has to move teams forward to accomplish a build regardless of the obstacles.
This takes the ability to think creatively to find alternate solutions or creative ways to solve problems.

Another essential skill — but often undervalued — is negotiating.
As projects evolve, software architects are negotiating all the time.
It might be negotiating timelines with developers that think they can’t complete tasks on deadlines or getting
stakeholders to understand the trade-off between feature sets, cost, and timing.
A great software architect is a great negotiator.

# How to become a software architect

If you’re looking to transition from your current role into a software architect position, there are a couple of key
things you should be doing right now.

## Expand your technical

Expand your technical skills - A software architect is a full-stack developer. You’ll need broad experience across
multiple programming languages. If you’ve been creating work primarily in one area, you’ll need to learn others.
Manage projects and people. Find opportunities within your current job where you can take on extra responsibility.

## Look for a mentor

Find someone you respect that has the job you want and ask for coaching. The right mentor can help you achieve your
goals and can be a lifelong resource.

## Continuing education

Consider getting outside training to shore up the skills you need and look for certifications that will bolster your
case when you’re applying for jobs.
The best opportunity to move into a software architect role is likely within your current organization. Don’t overlook
the power of letting managers know your desire and work with them to find opportunities to prove yourself.
