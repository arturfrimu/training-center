Public setters in object-oriented programming are often viewed as a necessary part of 
JavaBeans convention but can lead to poor encapsulation. 
When setters are used without discretion, they expose the internals of a class, 
allowing clients to modify the state of an object in ways that might be incompatible with the business logic the class is meant to enforce. 
This can lead to violations of invariants, which are conditions that should always hold true for an instance of a class.

For instance, consider an entity Tamagotchi with a status field. The status of a Tamagotchi might dictate whether certain fields can be updated or not. 
A PENDING Tamagotchi, for instance, should not have its name changed. Traditional setters do not allow for this kind of logic to be easily encapsulated within the entity. 
Instead, they invite the risk of the developer placing these integrity checks outside the entity, in service-layer code, 
which scatters business logic and increases the risk of errors.

Moreover, not all string values are permissible for fields like name. 
A public setter does not communicate any constraints on its values, nor does it enforce them. 
This means additional checks are necessary wherever the setter is called, rather than within the entity itself, 
leading to duplicated code and a higher likelihood of bugs if a check is omitted or implemented inconsistently.

A field may also be an implementation detail not meant to be directly manipulated. 
Public setters offer no protection against such unintended use, violating the principle of least privilege by exposing more functionality than necessary.

The alternative is to use methods that define specific behavior, such as changeName in the Tamagotchi class. 
Such methods can encapsulate the rules governing when and how a field can be updated. 
They keep the validation logic close to the data it validates, allowing the entity to protect its invariants. 
If an operation is not allowed, the method can throw an exception, providing a fail-fast mechanism that alerts the developer to the issue immediately.

In the provided example, the changeName method enforces that the name can only be changed if the Tamagotchi is not PENDING. 
It also checks if the new name is valid based on some internal criteria defined by the nameIsValid method. 
This enforces the business rule within the entity and prevents invalid data from being set, which would be harder to catch if a simple setter were used.

This approach has several benefits:

Encapsulation of Business Rules: By placing the validation logic within the entity, the entity itself ensures that it always remains in a valid state.

Reduction of Code Duplication: Centralizing the validation logic means that it does not need to be repeated wherever an update might occur.

Improved Maintainability: Business rules are defined in one place, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.

Increased Robustness: The entity can protect itself from being put into an invalid state, reducing the likelihood of bugs.

In conclusion, while setters have their place, they should be used judiciously. 
By leveraging methods that encapsulate behavior and validation, 
entities can maintain their integrity and the overall design of the system can be more robust and aligned with object-oriented design principles.
