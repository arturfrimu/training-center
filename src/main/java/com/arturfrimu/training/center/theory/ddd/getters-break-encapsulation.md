**The debate over the use of getters in object-oriented programming**, particularly in the context of domain-driven design, is not as straightforward as it might seem. 
While getters, unlike setters, do not directly mutate the state of an object, they can still contribute to breaking encapsulation and lead to an anemic domain model. 
**This happens when business logic** that should belong to the domain model is implemented outside of it, such as in service layers or controllers.

## The Problem with Getters
**Getters expose the internal state** of an object to the outside world. 
**This might seem harmless** at first because getters don't change the state of the object. 
**However, exposing internal state means** that the logic operating on this state can be spread out across the system, 
rather than being encapsulated within the domain objects.

### Consider the Tamagotchi example: 
**The domain rule is** that a Tamagotchi's name should not be changed if its status is ERROR. 
**If you provide a getter for the status field**, it becomes tempting for developers to implement the check for this rule outside the Tamagotchi class, 
say in a service layer, as shown in the provided code snippet. 
**This leads to scattered business logic and violates the principle of encapsulation.**

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class TamagotchiService {
    private final TamagotchiRepository repo;

    @Transactional
    public void changeName(UUID id, String name) {
        Tamagotchi tamagotchi = repo.findById(id).orElseThrow();
        if (tamagotchi.getStatus() == ERROR) {
            throw new TamagotchiStatusException("Tamagotchi cannot be modified because its status is ERROR");
        }
        tamagotchi.changeName(name);
    }
}
```

### Encapsulation and Domain Logic
**The essence of object-oriented programming is** encapsulation - keeping data and the operations on that data tied together. 
**When getters are used** indiscriminately, they can lead to a situation where data is freely accessible while operations on that data are elsewhere. 
**This separation makes the code more** difficult to maintain and understand.

**A better approach is** to keep the business logic within the domain model. 
In the Tamagotchi case, the check for the ERROR status should be within the changeName method of the Tamagotchi class. 
This way, the Tamagotchi class has control over its own data and behavior, and it enforces its own rules.

### Dealing with Querying and DTOs
**A common argument for using getters is** the need to transform domain objects into Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for communication with external systems or for API responses. 
**While it's true that getters are** useful in this scenario, they should be used judiciously.

**One approach is to** only expose the necessary data through getters and keep business logic within the domain model. 
**For instance, it may be** harmless to have a getter for something like a name field if this field does not have complex business logic associated with it. 
**However, for more complex scenarios, consider** using domain methods that return the necessary data in a controlled manner.

### Exception for IDs
**An exception to the rule against getters can be** made for entity IDs. 
**Since IDs are often needed for** practical reasons, such as database retrieval or referencing, and they typically don't involve business logic, 
it's generally acceptable to expose them via getters.

### Conclusion
**In conclusion, while getters and setters are** fundamental tools in Java and many object-oriented languages, 
their use should be carefully considered in the context of domain-driven design. 
**The key is to ensure that** business logic remains within the domain model. 
**By doing so, you can create** a more robust, maintainable, and coherent system that aligns with the principles of encapsulation and object-oriented design.
